## Background
- This is related to
	- [my Linux Installation Guides](https://github.com/Thanatisia/distro-install-guides)

## Remarks
- Some of you may have noticed that I previously had a repository named 'linux-setup-wm'
	- On 2022-03-14 1758H 
		I decided to Archive that individual repository and merged it with this superset repository for 
		my 'suite' of Linux Installation & Setup guides, tips n tricks & related files
		- as it feels that it is unnecessary to be a standalone repository
		- link to the repository is here [Setup - Window Managers](Setup%20-%20Window Managers)
